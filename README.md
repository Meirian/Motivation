# Motivation

The data set below indicates a researcher's motivation level (scored out of 10) towards their research project over time. 
Time, t, is measured in years since their thesis start date.


## Challenge

1. Download and save the data set to your computer
2. Use the scatter function in MATLAB to plot the data
3. Fit a polynomial model to the data *(Hint: you may need to try different degrees)*
4. Plot your fitted model on your scatterplot
5. Use the LaTeX interpreter to change the plot title to be Motivation as a function of time (t), using your fitted model
6. Export your MATLAB code and plot to LaTeX
7. Open the .tex file and compile it into a .pdf
